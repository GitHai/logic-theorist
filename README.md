# logic-theorist - The sources of the first theorem prover.

This repository contains a scan of the full sources of Newell/Simon's Logical Theorist,
the first theorem proving program.

The sources are part of technical report P-868 of the Rand Corporation (1956; see
http://shelf1.library.cmu.edu/IMLS/MindModels/logictheorymachine.pdf.)

A transcription would be very welcome.
